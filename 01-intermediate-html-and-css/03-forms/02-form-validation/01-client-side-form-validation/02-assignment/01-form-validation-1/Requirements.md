Form validation 1

In this task, we are providing you with a simple support query form, and we want you to add some validation features to it:

    Make all of the input fields mandatory to complete before the form can be submitted.
    Change the type of the "Email address" and "Phone number" fields to make the browser apply some more specific validation suitable for the data being asked for.
    Give the "User name" field a required length of between 5 and 20 characters, the "Phone number" field a maximum length of 15 characters, and the "Comment" field a maximum length of 200 characters.

Try submitting your form â€” it should refuse to submit until the above constraints are followed, and give suitable error messages. To help, you might want to consider adding some simple CSS to show when a form field is valid or invalid.
